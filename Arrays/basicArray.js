// Basic Array:
//1.  Define a variable named colors and assign it an array containing strings representing different colors (e.g., "red", "green", "blue").
//2.  Log the first element of the colors array to the console.
//3.  Change the second element of the colors array to "yellow". Log the second element of the colors array to the console to verify the change.
//4. Add a new color to the end of the colors array. Log the last element of the colors array to the console.


let color = ["red", "green", "blue"];
console.log(color[0]);
color[1]= "yellow";
console.log(color[1]);
color[3]= "pink";
console.log(color[3]);
